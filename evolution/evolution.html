                <h3>Charles Darwin And His Early Research With His Theory of Evolution</h3>
                <p>
                        The diversification of species over time. This idea of evolution was first introduced by Charles Darwin who was a British naturalist. He first introduced this idea in a book that he published called On the Origin of Species. This book suggested that all of the different living species can trace their species history back to a common ancestor. It also introduced the idea of natural selection. Natural selection is where certain heritable traits, such as hair color, are favorable in some environments, and those traits get passed down through generations. Charles Darwin came up with these ideas when he went on a voyage to the Galapagos Islands. Darwin was sailing to many different places studying studying his theory, and when he came to the Galapagos Islands, he noticed something about the finches there. He noticed that some of the finches had large beaks and some had smaller beaks. He studied the finches closer to find out why this was and he found that the finches with larger beaks ate large seeds, and the birds with smaller beaks were eating insects. The reason for this he found was it was easier for the birds with large beaks to get the seeds and eat them whereas the birds with smaller beaks would not be able to do so. However, the birds with smaller beaks made it easier for them to kill the insects and eat them, where the birds with larger beaks would struggle with that. These different heritable traits that the finches had, helped Darwin a lot with his research and gave him a lot of evidence for his theory.

                <ul>
                    <li>Charles Darwin, a british naturalist, first proposed the idea of 
                        biological evolution by natural selection</li>
                    <li>Darwin defined evolution as “descent with modification” the 
                        idea that species change over time, give rise to new species, and share a common ancestor. </li>
                    <li>
                            The mechanism that Darwin proposed for evolution is natural selection.
                             Because resources are limited in nature, organisms with
                              heritable traits that favor survival and reproduction 
                            will tend to leave more offspring than their peers, causing the 
                            traits to increase in frequency over generations
                    </li>
                    <li>Natural selection causes populations to become adapted, or increasingly well-suited, to their
                         environments over time. Natural selection depends on the environment and requires existing 
                         heritable variation in a group</li>

                <p>Microevolution is defined as evolutionary change within a species or a small group of organisms, especially over a short period, it is just evolution on a very small scale. Microevolution and macroevolution are often contrasted. Macroevolution is evolution but on a much larger scale. Biologists theorize that microevolution and macroevolution are the same exact processes, just happening at different rates based on the scale they are being measured. An allele is a form of a gene that controls a certain feature of an organism where there are different features depending on the different allele assortments. An allele frequency is how often that feature, or trait, appears in a population. A gene pool is basically all of the different types of genes in a population. Gene pools are important because all of the organisms that have genes in a gene pool have alleles being expressed and you can find the allele frequency of a gene in a gene pool because that is where you will find all the information you will need. This also helps us see genetic diversity and how much variation in genes there is in a population. This means that the more diverse a population is, the better chance it has to adapt to changes in the environment through natural selection. </p>

                    <li>Microevolution is a change in the frequency of gene variants, alleles, in a population, typically occurring over a relatively short time period.
                        </li>
                    <li>Population genetics is the field of biology that studies allele frequencies in populations and how they change over time.
                        </li>
                    <li>Allele frequency refers to how common an allele is in a population. It is determined by counting how many times the allele appears in the population then dividing by the total number of copies of the gene.
                        </li>
                    <li>The gene pool of a population consists of all the copies of all the genes in that population

                        The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a state that a population can be in that guarantees there to be no evolution given 5 circumstances. Those circumstances are no mutation, random mating, no gene flow, infinite population size, and no selection. These five things are all mechanisms of evolution. Mutation, though it is rare, is how populations first vary genetically. Most mutations don’t do anything, they might just be a little bit of messed up dna, however sometimes mutations can cause many different things to happen, such as an unusual eye color or unusual color of fur. Non-random mating is when certain organisms mate with others of the same or different genotypes depending on physical features. Gene flow is the flow of genes into a population, or out of one. This introduces populations with new genes that creates genetic diversity for the next generation. Non-infinite population size (genetic drift) is when allele frequencies change due to chance events. And finally, natural selection. Natural selection happens when an organism has an allele that makes it more or less fit for their given environment.  If an allele is less fit for a certain environment, the frequency for that allele will drop. If an allele is favored by a certain environment, then the frequency of that allele will grow in that population.

                        <li>When a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a gene, it is not evolving and allele frequencies will stay the same across generations
                            </li>
                        <li>There are five basic Hardy-Weinberg assumptions: no mutation, random mating, no gene flow, infinite population size, and no selection
                            </li>
                        <li>If the assumptions are not met for a gene, the population may evolve for that gene (the gene allele frequencies may change.)</li>
                        <li>Mechanisms of evolution correspond to violations of different Hardy-Weinberg assumptions. They are: mutation, non-random mating, gene flow, finite population size (genetic drift), and natural selection.</li>

                <p>Genetic drift is defined by: Variation in the relative frequency of different genotypes in a small population, owing to the chance disappearance of particular genes as individuals die or do not reproduce. This happens in all non-infinite populations, however it is more prominent in smaller populations. When genetic drift happens, it affects the whole population, it doesn’t favor certain genes or traits an organism might have in that population. </p>

                    <li>Genetic drift may result in the loss of some alleles (including beneficial ones) and the fixation, or rise to 100% frequency, of other alleles.</li>
                    <li>Genetic drift can have major effects when a populations is sharply reduced in size by a natural disaster (Bottleneck effect) or when a small group splits off from the main population to found a colony (founder effect)</li>
